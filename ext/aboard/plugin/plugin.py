"""Module containing the abstract Plugin class."""

class Plugin:
    
    """Parent class for all plugins.
    
    To create a plugin, a user must inherit from this class.  A
    plugin is a set of code which is designed to extend the abilities
    of the Python Aboard framework, by using other libraries for
    instance.
    
    In order to modify the behaviour of Python Aboard, a plugin uses
    events:  it can subscribe to listen and be called when a specific
    action occurs.  For instance, a plugin could be called any time
    a request is sent to the server.
