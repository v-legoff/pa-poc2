This second Proof of Concept should use a basic HTTP server to
manipulate datas through the data connector system developed in
the first POC.  The main goals of this POC are:
1. Move the developed part in the framework sub-directory to
   add user's own applications
2. Build a simple HTTP server using the cherrypy library
3. Define a router, easily configurable, establishing routes between
   HTTP requests and resources
4. Create other data connectors (SQL or NoSQL) and, above all,
   a "postgreSQL" data copnnecotr
